v0.03  -- Sped up s_mp_mul_high_digs by not computing the carries of the lower digits
       -- Fixed a bug where mp_set_int wouldn't zero the value first and set the used member.
       -- fixed a bug in s_mp_mul_high_digs where the limit placed on the result digits was not calculated properly
       -- fixed bugs in add/sub/mul/sqr_mod functions where if the modulus and dest were the same it wouldn't work
       -- fixed a bug in mp_mod and mp_mod_d concerning negative inputs
       -- mp_mul_d didn't preserve sign
       -- Many many many many fixes
       -- Works in LibTomCrypt now :-)
       -- Added iterations to the timing demos... more accurate.
       -- Tom needs a job.
