v0.07  -- Removed alot of heap operations from core functions to speed them up
       -- Added a root finding function [and mp_sqrt macro like from MPI]
       -- Added more to manual 

Dec 31st, 2002
v0.06  -- Sped up the s_mp_add, s_mp_sub which inturn sped up mp_invmod, mp_exptmod, etc...
       -- Cleaned up the header a bit more
       
Dec 30th, 2002
v0.05  -- Builds with MSVC out of the box
       -- Fixed a bug in mp_invmod w.r.t. even moduli
       -- Made mp_toradix and mp_read_radix use char instead of unsigned char arrays
       -- Fixed up exptmod to use fewer multiplications
       -- Fixed up mp_init_size to use only one heap operation
          -- Note there is a slight "off-by-one" bug in the library somewhere
             without the padding (see the source for comment) the library 
             crashes in libtomcrypt.  Anyways a reasonable workaround is to pad the
             numbers which will always correct it since as the numbers grow the padding
             will still be beyond the end of the number
       -- Added more to the manual
       
Dec 29th, 2002
v0.04  -- Fixed a memory leak in mp_to_unsigned_bin
       -- optimized invmod code
       -- Fixed bug in mp_div
       -- use exchange instead of copy for results
       -- added a bit more to the manual
       
Dec 27th, 2002
v0.03  -- Sped up s_mp_mul_high_digs by not computing the carries of the lower digits
       -- Fixed a bug where mp_set_int wouldn't zero the value first and set the used member.
       -- fixed a bug in s_mp_mul_high_digs where the limit placed on the result digits was not calculated properly
       -- fixed bugs in add/sub/mul/sqr_mod functions where if the modulus and dest were the same it wouldn't work
       -- fixed a bug in mp_mod and mp_mod_d concerning negative inputs
       -- mp_mul_d didn't preserve sign
       -- Many many many many fixes
       -- Works in LibTomCrypt now :-)
       -- Added iterations to the timing demos... more accurate.
       -- Tom needs a job.       

Dec 26th, 2002
v0.02  -- Fixed a few "slips" in the manual.  This is "LibTomMath" afterall :-)
       -- Added mp_cmp_mag, mp_neg, mp_abs and mp_radix_size that were missing.
       -- Sped up the fast [comba] multipliers more [yahoo!]

Dec 25th,2002
v0.01  -- Initial release.  Gimme a break.
       -- Todo list, 
           add details to manual [e.g. algorithms]
