/* LibTomMath, multiple-precision integer library -- Tom St Denis

 * LibTomMath is a library that provides multiple-precision

 *
 * The library was designed directly after the MPI library by
 * Michael Fromberger but has been written from scratch with
 * additional optimizations in place.
 *
 * The library is free for all purposes without any express
 * guarantee it works.
