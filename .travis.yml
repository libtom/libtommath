# Failed tests in test_*.log
# Files do not exist in case of success

# In case of a Travis error a success might get signaled
# even without any test run. This file also keeps any notes
# printed from the tests which might come handy from time
# to time.
# Valgrid will print its output to stderr which will not show up
# in test_*.log. testme.sh accepts one additional option to
# valgrind and "--valgrind-options=--log-fd=1" sends the output
# of Valgrind to stdout instead.
